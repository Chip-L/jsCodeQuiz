# JS Code Quiz

## Description

Build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.

I started with pseudocode: [jsCodeGame-Pseudocode.txt](./assets/misc/jsCodeGame-Pseudocode.txt)

I had a hard time with getting the JSON that I used to store the questions in to work properly. I couldn't get it to import the file without adding extra overhead. But the object I stored wouldn't escape '\n' and '\"' charcters correctly so I substitued those characters with placeholders and then swapped them back out when I was displaying the lines in HTML.
